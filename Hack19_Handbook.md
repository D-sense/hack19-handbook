**Hack'19**, the first of its kind **International Flutter Hackathon**, organised by the Flutter Community and supported by the Flutter team at Google is just around the corner, and I thought that I should attempt to curate some helpful resources, to help the participants get to speed.


## About Hack'19
If you don't know about Hack'19 then let me give you a brief introduction.

**Hack'19**, to be organised on the **1st of June, 2019**, is the First International Flutter Hackathon, spanning over an entire day. Interested developers can participate in a team of 2-5 people and build something amazing on Flutter or Flutter Web. By the end of the day, all the participants themselves vote for their favourite projects and the winners shall receive amazing prizes.
